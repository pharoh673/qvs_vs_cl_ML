üéì Quantum vs Classical Classifier ‚Äî Mini QML Project
üß† Overview

This project compares a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) built with Qiskit Machine Learning to a classical Logistic Regression model from scikit-learn, using synthetic circular data to test performance on a non-linear classification task.
The goal was to understand how quantum feature mapping and entanglement can outperform linear classical models on complex boundaries.

‚öóÔ∏è Project Objectives

Build and train a VQC using quantum circuits (feature map + ansatz).

Compare against a classical baseline trained on the same dataset.

Visualize decision boundaries and accuracies for both.

Learn practical steps in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) using Qiskit.

üß© Dataset

Two synthetic datasets were generated:

Unbalanced Dataset: circle with 39% positive samples

Classical accuracy: 0.60

Quantum accuracy: 0.675

Balanced Dataset: 50/50 class distribution

Classical accuracy: 0.394

Quantum accuracy: 0.706

Each dataset contained 2D points labeled by whether they fall inside or outside a circle ‚Äî a classic non-linear boundary problem.

Results

The Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) consistently outperformed the classical Logistic Regression baseline:

Dataset	Classical (LogReg)	Quantum (VQC)
Unbalanced	0.60	0.675
Balanced	0.394	0.706

Key Takeaways

Quantum models excel when data has non-linear, entangled relationships.

Even a 2-qubit VQC can outperform classical baselines on small datasets.

QML offers a bridge between quantum physics and data science, demonstrating real computational advantages in expressive modeling.
